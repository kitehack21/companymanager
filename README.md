## Available Scripts

In the project directory run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

In the api directory `/companymanager/managerapi` you can run :

### `node .`

This will run the api server locally on [http://localhost:1994](http://localhost:1994)

MySQL is used for data storage, and requires the following tables and columns:

## System Design

Data handling is mostly done through the global state

The system uses two reducers, one for all company data and the other for all office data

```
export default combineReducers({
    companies: CompanyReducer,
    offices: OfficeReducer
})
```

The component `OverviewPage` recieves the companies reducer

```
const mapStateToProps = (state) =>{
    const { companies }= state
    return { companies }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, {getCompanies})(OverviewPage)
```

Then the company data will be displayed with `CompanyCard` component via mapping

```
if(this.props.companies.length === 0){
            return(
                <div>There are no companies created yet</div>
            )
        }
        else{
            var arrJSX = this.props.companies.map((company) => {
                return(<CompanyCard key={company.id} id={company.id} name={company.name} address={company.address} revenue={company.revenue} phoneCode={company.phoneCode} phoneNumber={company.phoneNumber} history={this.props.history}/>)
            })
            return arrJSX
        }
```

The component `OfficesPage` recieves the companies and offices reducer.
Upon selection of a `CompanyCard` the page will be redirected to `/companies/:companyId` , in which companyId will be passed from the id of the selcted company

Since the companies reducer contains data for all companies, it is first filtered via looping to acquire the data of the selected company

![alt text](./readmeimages/params.jpg)   `props.match.params.companyId = 13`

```
const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => {
    const { companies, offices } = state
    var selectedCompany = {}
    for(var index in companies){
        if(parseInt(props.match.params.companyId) === parseInt(companies[index].id)){
            selectedCompany = companies[index]
        }
    }

    return { selectedCompany, offices }
}
```

The offices reducer is also filtered to only obtain data for the offices of the selected company. Filtering is done in the `RenderOffices()` function of the `OfficesPage` component.

```
    renderOffices(){
        var arrJSX = this.props.offices.map((office) => {
            if(parseInt(office.companyId) === parseInt(this.props.match.params.companyId))
                return(
                <Officecard key={office.id} id={office.id} name={office.name} longitude={office.longitude} latitude={office.latitude} startDate={office.startDate}/>
            )
        })
        console.log(arrJSX)
        if(arrJSX.length === 0){
            return(
                <div>There are no offices created yet</div>
            )
        }
        else{
            return arrJSX
        }
    }
```
